1. Create virtual host with root folder /public
2. Give "read" and "write" permissions to /source and /bootstrap folders
3. Create ".env" file and fill in the data (there is example inside)
4. Install npm modules and composer
5. Type "php artisan key:generate"
6. Type "php artisan migrate"
7. Enjoy the site



P.S. If you have PHP version 5.4 or higher you can write "php artisan serve" and server will be created and u don't need virtual host.
